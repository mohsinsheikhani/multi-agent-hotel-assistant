# Multi-Agent Hotel Booking Assistant

> **AWS AI Engineering Month Competition Submission**  
> *Building with Agents using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore and AWS Strands*

A production-ready multi-agent system that transforms complex hotel booking workflows into natural conversations through intelligent agent orchestration.

## The Problem

Hotel booking involves complex workflows: search, policy evaluation, booking management, and communication. Traditional systems force users through rigid interfaces, requiring multiple interactions for simple changes and leaving customers frustrated when policies aren't clear upfront.

**Real-world pain points:**
- 2 AM booking changes that require calling customer service
- Hidden cancellation fees discovered too late
- Starting over when modifying existing bookings
- No memory of previous preferences or conversations

## The Solution

Instead of building another booking form, I created a team of AI specialists that work together like a hotel's back-office staff:

## Architecture Overview

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
- **Supervisor Agent**: Orchestrates workflows with persistent memory and policy-aware routing
- **Specialized Agents**: Each handles a specific domain (search, booking, policies, notifications)
- **A2A Communication**: Agents collaborate through Agent-to-Agent protocols
- **Policy-Aware Workflows**: Automatic compliance checking before any booking action

### Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Integration
- **Memory Service**: Persistent conversation context across sessions (7-day retention)
- **Gateway Service**: Secure Lambda function access via Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Runtime Service**: Production deployment with automatic scaling and observability
- **Identity Service**: OAuth2 authentication with fine-grained access control

### AWS Infrastructure
- **Lambda Functions**: Business logic for hotel inventory, booking, and policy management
- **DynamoDB**: Hotel inventory and reservation data storage
- **Cognito**: Authentication and authorization for AgentCore Gateway
- **Knowledge Base**: Hotel policies and advisory information (Bedrock Knowledge Base)

## Key Capabilities

### Intelligent Conversations
```
User: "I need to cancel my booking for next week, but I'm worried about fees."

Traditional System: Navigate ‚Üí Find booking ‚Üí Read policy ‚Üí Call support ‚Üí Wait ‚Üí Explain...

Our System: 
1. Supervisor identifies policy-sensitive cancellation
2. Guest Advisory Agent retrieves specific policy
3. Reservation Agent calculates exact fees and alternatives
4. Present clear options: "Cancelling now = $50 fee, modifying dates = free until tomorrow"
5. User chooses, system executes, confirmation sent
```

### Memory That Matters
- Remembers preferences across sessions ("ground floor rooms like last time")
- Maintains conversation context ("your previous concern about cancellation fees")
- Enables intelligent recommendations based on history

### Production-Ready Architecture
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when components fail
- **Observability**: Deep insights into agent interactions and performance
- **Scalability**: Independent agent scaling based on demand
- **Security**: End-to-end authentication and authorization
